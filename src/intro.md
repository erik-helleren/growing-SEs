# Introduction

This book is NOT about how to manage software engineering teams.  Its not about how to grow someones career, at least not directly.  

This book is about practical techniques to quickly and efficiently develop hard skills and thought patterns in the work place.  

## Consent and transparency  

These techniques are not magic.  They become no less powerful if the student knows what they are or how to apply them.  So don't be afraid to share this resource with them. 


## Feedback
Not only does this let them know you are doing what you are doing, it also opens the door for feedback.  Could you have applied one of these techniques better?  Outside of having a coach present during your working sessions, your students provide the best feedback.  


## Contributions  

If you have a technique, tool, or idea you want to see included in this book, open up a PR please.
