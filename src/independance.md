# Fostering Independence

One of the trickiest things to do while teaching and growing engineers is to avoid the various forms of dependance that can crop up.  

## Forms of dependance

Learned helplessness 

Asking permission

## Have multiple teachers
Don't make yourself the only expert

## Peer when possible
Have the Jr engineer talk to a peer working on similar things.  

Make sure to collect regular feedback from both of them to ensure that the relationship is mutually beneficial.
