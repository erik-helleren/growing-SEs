# Core skills

Here are a set of core skills and ideas to keep in mind when helping others grow

## They are human

One of Sprout's core values is to care deeply, so I would be remiss if I did not stress this as the first and arguably most important item in this writing: Your mentee is a human. I know this seems pretty obvious, but I can't stress this enough.  Humans want to feel valued, appreciated, and like they are making progress towards growth.  They also make mistakes as they grow. Always mentor with compassion first. Period.  

Properly timed and worded praise communicates your mentee is on the right path, and helps to increase engagement keeping you both motivated.  

When introducing a new skill or concept take opportunities whenever possible to provide postive and specific feedback.  For example, "You nailed the structure of this class. all the methods are small, clear, and well named".   Delivering constructive feedback in a way that builds someone up isn't easy.  More on positive and negative [feedback later](./feedback.html)


## A long marathon
A career is a marathon, not a sprint.  One that is measured in decades, not years, months or weeks. Habits and skills take time and pratice to become second nature.  This is esepeically true for software engineers, where there is a not only a large depth and breadth of understanding expected of senior engineers, but an ability to ask the right questions and conduct research efficiently into unknown concepts.  

All this growth takes time.  The important thing is that there is a positive derivative of skill and that positive derivative is proportional to the effort others put into growing the mentee.  

The growth we see as senior engineers can seem slow to us because we have already ingrained these skills and habits. We see the bug before they have finished the line, or notice the production risk that the unit tests aren't covering on the code review. We have practiced these skills for years and these are skills that get better with practice. They are not learned overnight.  This is especially true for some slills like:

-  Identifying the difference between fact and assumption on the fly
-  Thinking about problems in the context of a system's architecture
-  Dealing with production systems etc.
-  How to refactor code
-  Thinking about non-functional requirements: Performance, fault tolerance, scalability, security, etc.
- Supportability

Lastly, sometimes our mentees come to us at different levels, which can warp our expectations. There are several factors that could impact how prepared a Jr se is for that first day of their career.

- Quality of their internship experiences
- Classes that they took (Software testing, software engineering, distributed computing, etc)
- Method of the courses taken (Project based, lab based, theory based)

These are things which, at the very least, are not fully in the control of the mentee which impacts their starting point.  So be kind and understanding, and meet them where they are.  Thats the only way for you to have an impact on where they are going.  

## Become the student
Don't be afraid to become the student because our Mentees have stuff to teach us.  This is boarding a truisim, since we can all learn from everyone.  I know its almost cliche, but its true.  

There have been a handfull of times where a jr engineer called out a fault assumption of mine, or propsed a better solution than the one I had in mind.  Cherish those moments, and dig into their process so they understand how awesome they just did.  

Beyond project work, pay special atention to are things that your mentee might not conciously share: their learning style.  TODO more details.  

## Documentation
Sometimes, we get so swept up with one on one interactions that forget that documentation plays a key role in helping onboard our mentees, and share knowledge around the team.  

Some key things that you should try to have documented for your team:
- Your SDLC, even if its just a standard model.  Having just a link is ok.
- Team structure
- Production support 
- Runbooks for common prod issues

Its imporant to keep in mind that for Jr engineers, this may be the first time they see some of these concepts.  

## Thinking time
So often we get the "I am stuck, please help" message on slack, and we show up to our mentee in troubleshooting mode.  It is natural that we want to fix the problem they are facing.  Especially when they are frustrated, having been stuck on something for an hour or so.  But its critical to resist.  

Giving the mentee time to think is ciritcal.  This involves awkward silences, and not the type of silence where you can check email.  Get a fidget spinner or other quite fidgit device if you are like me and find patience difficult.  

Provide a promt for thought, and then stay out of your mentee's way.  It can be uncomfortable for all as they struggle with the question or suguestion.  *Its the silence where the mentee can develop those tricky skills through pratice.*

Take time to think yourself when working with your mentee.  If your mentee seems stuck, and you aren't sure where to go next or what to try, say so and then think about it before running off on the first thought that comes to mind.

## The power of thought
The goal is to instill behaviors and methods that allow the jr engineer to answer their own questions, develop their own code, deploy their own software, and know when and where to go to the team with ideas, concerns, and oppertunities.  

## You are human

You are human too.  You are going to make mistakes, miss opertunites to help your mentee learn, provide poorly worded feedback, and provide bad advice to name but a few.  Be honest with yourself and your mentee.  Tell them when you did something wrong and use it as a learning opertunity for both of you.  

At the end of the day, give yourself permission to mess up on all things except one: Caring about your mentee.  Everything else is forgivable.
