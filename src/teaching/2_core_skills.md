# Core concepts

Here are a set of core concepts to keep in mind when helping others grow

## Students are human

One of Sprout Social's [core values](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/refreshing-sprouts-values/) is to care deeply, so I would be remiss if I did not stress this as the first and arguably most important item in this book: Your student is a human. I know this seems pretty obvious, but it can't be stressed enough.  Humans want to feel valued, appreciated, and like they are making progress towards growth.  They also make mistakes as they grow. Always teach with *compassion first*.   

Properly timed and worded praise communicates your student is on the right path, and helps to increase engagement, keeping you both motivated.  More on positive and negative [feedback](./feedback.html) later.


## A long marathon
A career is a marathon, not a sprint.  One that is measured in decades, not weeks, months, or years. Habits and skills take time and practice to become second nature.  This is especially true for software engineers, where there is a not only a large depth and breadth of understanding expected of senior engineers, but an ability to ask the right questions and conduct research efficiently into unknown concepts.  

All this growth takes time.  The important thing is that there is a positive derivative of skill and that positive derivative is proportional to the effort others put into growing the student.  

>Growth is a process, and a slow one.  Reflect on how long it took to get to where you are today if you ever get frustrated with the pace of progress.  

The growth we see as senior engineers can seem slow to us because we have already ingrained these skills and habits. We see the bug before they have finished the line, or notice the production risk that the unit tests aren't covering on the code review. We have practiced these skills for years and these are skills that get better with practice. They are not learned overnight.  This is especially true for some skills like:

-  Identifying the difference between fact and assumption on the fly
-  Thinking about problems in the context of a system's architecture
-  Dealing with production systems etc.
-  How to refactor code
-  Thinking about non-functional requirements: Performance, fault tolerance, scalability, security, etc.
- Supportability

Lastly, sometimes our students come to us at different levels, which can warp our expectations. There are several factors that could impact how prepared a Jr se is for that first day of their career.

- Quality of their internship experiences
- Classes that they took (Software testing, software engineering, distributed computing, etc)
- Method of the courses taken (Project based, lab based, theory based)

These are things which, at the very least, are not fully in the control of the student which impacts their starting point.  So be kind and understanding, and meet them where they are.  Thats the only way for you to have an impact on where they are going.  

### Pacing

Pacing is critical as we are introducing new concepts to our students.  If new concepts come too quickly, they become like a flood and proficiency can't be developed.  If they are too slow, our student could become disengaged.  

In general, try to have only a handful of skills at the "fundamental" and "developing -low" levels of proficiency.  Fundamental is defined as exposure to the concept or a rudimentary understanding of the skill.  Developing - low is defined as the first steps in learning a new skill.  The student my have internalized parts of the skill, or learned a few key behaviors, but they still need significant and consistent support to apply the skill.  

These two levels of proficiency are where skills are just starting to form, and where you are most likely to have to put on your teaching hat.  

"Developing - Medium" is where the student can perform many aspects of the skill, but is inconsistent overall.  This is where we shift from primarily teaching to a blend of coaching and teaching, depending on the context.  How know when to pick which is covered in the coaching chapter.  TODO link

## Always be a student

Being a teacher is defined based on intention and action in the moment.  You are only a teacher when you are teaching.  When in teaching mode, the goal is to impart knowledge and the mindset, often, is that of the expert.  This can inflate egos very quickly.  

At the same time, there is always something we can learn from our team members.  We can always benefit from being the student, and can always learn something new.

A key skill for you is the ability to switch off teacher mode to focus on being a student.  The members of your team should be treated as peers, regardless of title, who deserves to have their skills and knowledge respected.  The best way to show respect is to shift quickly and without ego into student mode when they have something to offer.      

This has many benefits:  First, your peer will feel valued for their skills.  They get to grow their teaching skills.  You may get to learn something new about software or about your peer.  You may even see new teaching strategies being applied, making you a better teacher.  

Please note that this is different from the teachback technique, where the goal is to critique your student as they learn a new concept or skill.  Here, you are a true student.  

## Documentation
Sometimes, we get so swept up with one on one interactions that we forget that documentation plays a key role in helping onboard new team members.  

Some key things that you should try to have documented for your team:
- Your SDLC, even if its just a standard model.  Having just a link to an external resource is ok.
- Team structure
- Production support tooling
- Runbooks for common prod issues

Its important to keep in mind that for Jr engineers just coming into industry, this may be the first time they see some of these concepts.  

## Silence is golden

While silence can be awkward, when it comes to growing the skills of software engineers, its importance cannot be understated.  This is also one of the hardest parts about transiting into a teacher mode from a regular peer mode.  Silence makes humans uncomfortable, as does the look of struggle that creeps over our students faces.  

But whats really happening in that silence between the prompt and the answer? The short answer is "ENGINEERING"!  Your student is applying their thought process to the prompt, be it a question, comment, or a prod like "Lets try to refactor this code".  The precise process varies from person to person and context to context.  For me, I try to start with a type of internal research to form hypothesis's, I then discarding some and refining the rest using the context, and ultimately make a choice.  At least, thats me at my best.  

> Its the silence between prompt and response where the student can practice the skills they need to succeed. 

For tactical advice, get comfortable with awkward silence.  I found that shadowing and performing interviews, if allowed at your company, is a great way to practice.  Candidates will invariably get stuck in that uncomfortable silence where you know the answer by can't say anything.  While the expectation varies based on job level and company, you may eventually prod them to the right answer and feel some relief.  Also, if you are like me and find patience difficult, consider a fidget spinner

Lastly, this silence does not need to be synchronous.  Especially for tricky problems or new problem spaces.  By putting in a thinking break, you set everyone up for success.  You can't provide hints or blurt out the answer, and you aren't stressed by having to sit there.  And its more likely to improve the student's outcome if your student is anxious, struggles under pressure, feels uncomfortable brainstorming out loud, or rushes to judgement.  You should stress that the student is still your priority during this break and explain why you are taking the break.  If you are not clear, this technique can come off as dismissive.  


## Process over result

Do not focus on the result, but instead the process that lead your student to that result.  Correct code can happen by accident, especially for small scope changes in Jr engineers.  

The goal of your teaching should be to instill a rigorous thought process that allow your student to be independent.  They should be able to: ask the right questions, identify their assumptions, answer their own questions thru research, develop their own code, deploy their own software, design systems, and know when to go to the team with ideas, concerns, or opportunities.  Of course, that takes years

## You are human

You are human too.  You are going to make mistakes, miss opportunities to help your student learn, provide poorly worded feedback, and provide bad advice.  Be honest with yourself and your student.  If you notice you did something sub-optimal, have a discussion about what happened and how it could have been done better.  Your candor will build trust and respect in while preparing your student to be a better teacher. 

First, by discussing *what* you could have handled it better, you reveal you are not some sage with universal knowledge.  Profession teachers all this [the sage on the stage](https://tophat.com/glossary/s/sage-on-the-stage/) model, or the teacher centered model.  It is defined as a 1 way communication model where the teacher knows all, and the students must absorb all.  This is not how engineering works.  By being forthright with your student, they see there is no "one right answer" for how to write code, design software, or architect systems.  This can develop an important skill I call push back, where a Jr engineer will respectfully question the ideas presented by a more Sr engineer or management.  By focusing on what could have been done better, you draw attention to the idea of process over result.  Especially when the end result of your pairing was a merge ready PR, or a resolved production issue.  

Second, by discussing *how* you could have handled the situation better, you improve everyone's ability to teach.  Teaching is a skill, just as engineering is.  And your best teaching teacher is your engineering student.  Sometimes they teach passively, other times, they actively help us grow our teaching skill.  Passive teaching on their part manifests by confusion, misunderstanding, and failing to meet expectations.  This is almost always signal of something.  It could have been the method you used wasn't ideal for the material or their learning style or your technique was just lacking.  It could also have been situational or personal issues that your student was distracted by that impacted the situation.  You will never know if you don't discuss.  Active teaching often presents itself as push back on your suggestions and candid feedback about your teaching style or method.  

Give yourself permission to mess up on all things except one: Caring about your student.  Everything else is just part of your learning process as a teacher.  Your openness and candor with your engineering student can only help you both grow.       



## Warp up

In this chapter we focused on some common concepts that will be key to your teaching practice.  All of these key skills boil down to two key points.  

First, we are humans thus imperfect.  As such imperfect beings, we should focus instead on growth.  This applies both to our students and ourselves.  The adage that "Life is a journey, not a destination" rings true at work as much as it does at home. 

Second,
