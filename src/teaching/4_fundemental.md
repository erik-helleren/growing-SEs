# Fundamental level

The fundamental level is all about helping your student get from 0 to 1 with a new skill.  

## Lectures

Lectures are a one directional flow of knowledge from presenter to audience member. When used in isolation, it doesn't support the deep understanding our engineers need.  As such, very few situations call for significant lecturing.  Exceptions typically have several of these traits: 

- It is difficult for a student to do self directed research on the subject because:  
  - There is limited content on the subject.
  - Significant existing content is misleading or wrong.
  - Its difficult to know where to start without a lot of context.
- There is a large body of theoretical knowledge that is required before it can be applied.  
- The subject is very theoretical and difficult to apply all together.

If you feel the need to lecture, its key that you prepare, preserve your lecture, and present well.  Preparation should consist of documentation describing the content you will be covering in enough depth to convey the subject you are covering.  Those notes don't need to be perfect, but they should be made available before your presentation and updated just after.  Likewise, preserve your lectures as often as possible via a recording.  It should capture your first and foremost.  Your slides should be an afterthought.  

Lastly, [present well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&t=6s) by knowing how to communicate your ideas.  Consider that video required watching if you want to lecture, noting that you are lecturing and not doing a job talk.  

## Directed research

Directed research is simply assigning research tasks to your student.  But doing directed research well is a bit more complex, requiring the right mindset, suitable material, and clear goals.

Before your student starts on their research, they need to know their destination.  Establishing a clear research objective is your job when using directed research.  A deliverable that requires the skill or knowledge that the student is researching is ideal.  This gives a strong signal to the student that they are learning and growing.  And they have hard proof because they were able to complete the deliverable.  

If there isn't a deliverable that makes sense in this context, seriously consider delaying the research until there is.  As a fallback, define specific learning objectives for your student.  

Be it a deliverable or learning objectives, the goal will serve to limit the scope of the research, so choose it with intention.  

The first breadcrumb that you give your student is often the most important, and there is where material comes in.  Providing the appropriate material to your student is one of the key ways that directed research is different from "just do your job".  The initial material provided should be reviewed to make sure it sets up the student to meet the goals.  If a student is good at doing detective work and following up on leads, it should not be comprehensive.  At the same time, it needs to provide enough foundational knowledge of the subject so they can succeed.  

Lastly, mindset of both the student and teacher is key.  As the teacher you should be keeping tabs on how your student is doing their directed research.  Like all skills, research is one that grows with feedback.  That said, try to limit your feedback till the end of the process, if you see the student struggling significantly, or they ask for help.  

As for the student's mindset, to do directed research well they must have some level of autonomy, self-discipline, knowing when to reach out for direction, and communication.  They also require a mindset that is both motivated by learning new things.  At the same time the need to request and accept help when its needed. 

To pull it all together, lets consider a vast subject like Spark on Yarn.  The teachers goal is to get the student familiar with how we use Spark, to learn some of the in's and outs of the code base, and to address a bug ticket.  If you were to email the directed research to them, here is what it could look like

> I would like you to take a pass on BUG-123.  This will involve adding a new map call in our spark batch job that is run every 6 hours.  _Here_ is a video which explains the basics of spark, _Here_ is the documentation describing the application that has the bug, and _here_ is a link to the code for some other mappings that do similar things.  Of course, _Here_ is the spark documentation.  Spark is a beast and this application might have a simple job, but that doesn't make it simple.  Given how hard this is, so I will hang out after standup daily if you want to talk about anything.  

In the above example, we provided details to orientate the person to the new framework and provide a base of knowledge.  Then some specific internal documentation, and lastly similar code to that which they will need to make. This is a trifecta, which gives the student the tools they need to start asking questions. Hopefully questions they can answer themselves.  At the same time, I level set that this is hard and I am here to help at a particular time.  

This last bit about making time daily is often underrated.  I have seen many peers be stuck for days makign little headway.  And all that it would have taken to get unstuck was to just ask for help.  Its important that we make work a safe place to ask for help, and that we not only encourage it, but we structure our time so it happens well before frustration.
