# Chapter 1

Also, a lot of the resources I pull may be about "teaching" "students", this is because there is a lot of theory, data, and practice around formal education.  The best techniques use blended resources (videos, readings, lecture notes), instruction (lecture, modeling), critical thinking (socratic method, reflection exercises), application (practice doing), and formative assessments (Designed to measure where more focus is needed, not so much to assign a grade).  In general, a lot of the stuff discussed in "how to be a better teacher" books, especially those targeted towards STEM teachers, are skills useful for a mentor for JR staff.  Teachers have to efficiently build new skills and behaviors, seeing students typically for 45 min each day, 20-30 at a time.   Books on coaching are often better for mentoring employees as they transition to Sr and beyond.   But both classes of book, in my experience, have ideas useful regardless of career level.


Gentle reminder, here are key transitions that may applicable to jr staff:

- Student -> Associate -> SE
- Student -> professional life

a job elsewhere -> A job at sprout

Part time jobs and internships -> Full Time jobs

One role at sprout -> another role at sprout (i.e. rotation)

Dorm life -> Apartment/ living alone life

High parental involvement -> Lower parental involvement

Short, clearly defined intervals on life (Semester, internship) with clear ending periods and super clear feedback -> Real life where, yes, we get feedback, but there are not clear end dates anywhere in the near future.  There isn't a graduation from a career outside of retirement.

Things to never lose focus on:
------------------------------

1.  Your mentee is a human.  Humans love making other humans happy.  Proper praise and smiles are helpful in boosting effort, output, satisfaction, and results.  (Citation needed)  Likewise scolding can deflate a person. (Citation not needed)  Even providing feedback that we view as helpful, can be taken wrong. 

1.  Take opportunities whenever possible to say "Yes, you nailed the structure of this class, all the methods are small, clear, and well named.".   Delivering constructive feedback in a way that builds someone up isn't easy.  

2.  (Erik TODO, find resources here)

3.  A career is a marathon, not a sprint.  Growth takes time.  The important thing is that there is a positive derivative of skill.  And that positive derivative is proportional to the effort others put into growing the mentee.  

1.  Growth seems slow for us because we have already done that growth.  We have practiced these skills for years.  And these are skills that get better with practice, they are not learned overnight:

1.  Identifying the difference between fact and assumption

2.  Systems thinking

3.  Dealing with production systems etc.

4.  How to refactor code

5.  Thinking about non-functional requirements: Performance, fault tolerance, scalability, security, etc.

5.  Don't be afraid to become the student.  Our Mentees often end up teaching their mentors stuff, or making mentors think about things differently.  

1.  How we can better support them specifically.  How do they think and learn?  How do they absorb information?  What methods work best for creating habits?

2.  How we can better support people who join the team in the future. Is there missing documentation? Or is the documentation hard to find?  

7.  Give them time to think, and don't be afraid to take time yourself to think.

1.  Many of the thoughts we have seem instant reflexes, but reflexes take time and practice. 

1.  To someone new to the team or the profession, these things take time.  

2.  Until they become second nature, they require significant thinking time to find the appropriate concepts, apply them, and turn them into words or code.  

3.  Its the above process that turns them into second nature in time.  Typically, identifying and applying concepts comes first, then the ability to verbalize or codealize them. Patience  

3.  If asked a question or not sure where to go next, take a breath.  

1.  If its taking a while, consider verbalizing what you are thinking.  Consider to "modeling" as you think about where to go and what to say next.

Tactics and tools
-----------------

1.  [Modeling](https://barkleypd.com/blog/instructional-strategy-modeling-why-how-and-why-not/) behavior.  AKA Teaching by doing.

1.  I do, we do, you do.  (See article for details)

2.  Start slow for "I do", thoroughly explain your thought process.  Highlight assumptions and make sure to validate them before completion. 

3.  If the mentee seems disengaged, shift to "we do".  Expect them to be much more involved.  You can still have the keyboard, but have [them navigate while you drive.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-driver)

4.  Don't be afraid to pull the mentee into YOUR work to model behaviors.  I.e. refactoring, IDE tools, Prod support, how you iterate on feedback on a PR, what your thought process is when giving feedback on a PR, etc.  

3.  Confirm understanding of lectures and complex new ideas by asking them to explain it back in their own words.  Also called [Teach-back method](http://www.teachbacktraining.org/home).  

1.  At the very least, this forces them to repeat the content back.  At the best, it can not only show you the connections they are making as they are learning content

2.  Do this frequently at first.  Don't be afraid to go like "Do you feel like you understand X better now?" "Yes I do", "Great, explain it to me in your own words" (Don't feel weird using that exact phrasing the first few times.)

3.  The goal is for the mentee to stop responding with "Yes" the first time and instead go right into confirming their understanding.

4.  Extra resource: <https://www.ahrq.gov/health-literacy/improve/precautions/tool5.html>  Both this and the other link are targeted towards healthcare professionals.  But I do think there is some overlap.  Think of this as the MOST extreme level of teach-back anyone can possibly do: Doctor to random patient.  

5.  Don't be afraid to dive deeper, and use those questions to drive the discussion on the next point.  See Socratic method.  

6.  Erik TODO: How to correct when there are issues with their explanation.

5.  Ask to understand their thought process

1.  Any time you ask a complex question (and sometimes a simple one) strongly consider taking a deep dive into how the answer was reached, regardless if it was right or wrong.  

2.  Focus is on the process of thought, not their conclusion.  When the process is correct, that generalizes. 

3.  I use "wrong" and "bad" interchangeably, to say a thought process that wasn't fully correct, based on bad assumptions, etc.  

4.  Resist the urge to jump in at the first wrong thing, or thing that could have been better.  Listen to the whole narrative and consider taking notes.  

5.  Example script after a question was answered: "Great, I like your answer.  How did you get there?" Using "how" focuses on the fact that answering questions is a process. 

6.  If the answer was right:

1.  It can identify luck vs understanding. 

2.  It allows you to re-enforce each positive link in the chain of thought

8.  If the answer was wrong:

1.  It can let you identify where it went wrong and correct just that link. 

2.  It allows you to re-enforce ALL the positive links in the chain, even ones after the "bad" one.  

7.  The art of the breadcrumb.  

1.  Finding the right breadcrumb with the right level of detail is a difficult skill that requires a good understanding of the context, as well as the recipient of the breadcrumb.  

1.  Should they have the knowledge to easily get to the next breadcrumb?

1.  Use your discretion and the context to decide if you want to make it Easy, Medium, Hard, or Insane difficulty level.  IMO, average toward medium or hard.

3.  Are there red herrings that might be lurking? (Red Herrings are a false lead, or something that can send the mentee off in the wrong direction)  

1.  If so, which ones should you highlights, and which should you leave lurking.  Real life has a lot of red herrings

2.  This impacts the difficulty of the breadcrumb significantly

3.  If there is a high risk, use scheduled checkins to stay on track.  

5.

3.  Back out the breadcrumb.  Once they have reached some reasonable point to pause, reflect how to get to that first breadcrumb.

1.  Vary Approaches here greatly.  

1.  Modeling forward and backwards

2.  Socratic forwards

3.

9.  Get the mentee to come up with the right answer using guided but open ended questions.  AKA the [Socratic Method](https://tilt.colostate.edu/TipsAndGuides/Tip/53#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Socratic%20Method,the%20students%20views%20and%20opinions.).  One difference is we want to do guided validation of that answer before ending the conversation.

1.  "is better used to demonstrate complexity, difficulty, and uncertainty than to elicit facts about the world." From [here](https://tilt.colostate.edu/TipsAndGuides/Tip/53)

2.  Resist the urge to clarify everything all at once.  As Socraties, its your job to guide the discussion where it needs to go for right now.

1.  Consider taking notes around areas that might need to be flushed out later, or for the mentee to do self study on.  

4.  Probably best done with the IDE open on the Mentee side and shared.  You can have yours open too

5.  Dealing with incorrectness

1.  Validate the assumption.  Literally "Lets try to validate that assumption you just made"

Other tactics
-------------

Tactics and tools that Erik has used, but may have mixed feelings about.  I.e. not things you should try first.

1.  A/B testing.  Come up with 2 solutions to the vague problem, where A is better than B.  Ask the mentee to consider both options, do any research they need to come to a conclusion, and come back with an argument in favor of A or B.    This can be used to both guide, and evaluate growth.  

1.  Cons

1.  Requires double the prework on your part. 

2.  Puts the mentee in a position to "pick wrong" from a situation which was open ended with many correct answers.

3.  It shuts the door to C, which is the best option, hands down, that you didn't think of yourself.

3.  Pros

1.  Puts up guardrails on vague and very open ended tasks.  Can prevent feeling overwhelmed or being stuck.

2.  If A OR B was chosen, that provides data around growth

3.  The reasoning behind the choice can give you concrete areas to focus growth on. 

5.  To be successful

1.  Both A and B MUST 

1.  meet functional requirements

2.  On their face, must seem like a reasonable course of action

3.  Be materially different from each other

3.  B must have clear and explainable reasons why its inferior.  

4.  Leave the door open to C.

5.  Be conscious of how concrete or vague your options are.  Try to leave wiggle room

1.  Most room: 

1.  Create a new class for the these DB interactions

2.  stick the logic in some well defined methods on an existing class 

3.  Less room:

1.  Create new class CarDbHandler that encapsulates all of the logic to interact with Car DB 

2.  add a method on existing class TruckDbHandler that pulls cars from the car DB.  

7.  Pause to discuss via a sync BEFORE too much effort is put into coding.  They are free to play around, and try things out in the code and even commit a rough draft.  But we don't want to spend a few days refactoring an inferior solution.
