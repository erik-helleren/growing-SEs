# Chapter 1

Also, a lot of the resources I pull may be about "teaching" "students", this is because there is a lot of theory, data, and practice around formal education.  The best techniques use blended resources (videos, readings, lecture notes), instruction (lecture, modeling), critical thinking (socratic method, reflection exercises), application (practice doing), and formative assessments (Designed to measure where more focus is needed, not so much to assign a grade).  In general, a lot of the stuff discussed in "how to be a better teacher" books, especially those targeted towards STEM teachers, are skills useful for a mentor for JR staff.  Teachers have to efficiently build new skills and behaviors, seeing students typically for 45 min each day, 20-30 at a time.   Books on coaching are often better for mentoring employees as they transition to Sr and beyond.   But both classes of book, in my experience, have ideas useful regardless of career level.


Gentle reminder, here are key transitions that may applicable to jr staff:

- Student -> Associate -> SE
- Student -> professional life

a job elsewhere -> A job at sprout

Part time jobs and internships -> Full Time jobs

One role at sprout -> another role at sprout (i.e. rotation)

Dorm life -> Apartment/ living alone life

High parental involvement -> Lower parental involvement

Short, clearly defined intervals on life (Semester, internship) with clear ending periods and super clear feedback -> Real life where, yes, we get feedback, but there are not clear end dates anywhere in the near future.  There isn't a graduation from a career outside of retirement.
